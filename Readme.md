# Yet Another Chimeric Read Detector for long reads

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/natir/yacrd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/natir/yacrd)

![yacrd pipeline presentation](image/pipeline.svg)

Using all-against-all read mapping, yacrd performs:

1. computation of pile-up coverage for each read
2. detection of chimeras

Chimera detection is done as follows:

1. for each region where coverage is smaller or equal than `min_coverage` (default 0), yacrd creates a _gap_.
2. if there is a gap that starts at a position strictly after the beginning of the read and ends strictly before the end of the read, the read is marked as `Chimeric`
3. if gaps length of extremity > 0.8 * read length, the read is marked as `Not_covered`

## Rationale

Long read error-correction tools usually detect and also remove chimeras. But it is difficult to isolate or retrieve information from just this step.

DAStrim (from the [DASCRUBBER suite](https://github.com/thegenemyers/DASCRUBBER) does a similar job to yacrd but relies on a different mapping step, and uses different (likely more advanced) heuristics. Yacrd is simpler and easier to use.

## Input

Any set of long reads (PacBio, Nanopore, anything that can be given to [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) ).
yacrd takes the resulting PAF (Pairwise Alignement Format) from minimap2 or MHAP file from some other long reads overlapper as input.

## Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in stable channel
- libgz
- libbzip2
- liblzma

## Instalation

### With cargo

If you have a rust environment setup you can run :

```
cargo install yacrd
```

### With conda

yacrd is avaible in [bioconda channel](https://bioconda.github.io/)

if bioconda channel is setup you can run :

```
conda install yacrd
```

### From source

```
git clone https://github.com/natir/yacrd.git
cd yacrd
git checkout v0.4

cargo build
cargo test
cargo install
```

## How to use Yacrd

### Find chimera

```
minimap2 reads.fq reads.fq | yacrd -o reads.yacrd
```

If you want save mapping intermediate file:
```
minimap2 reads.fq reads.fq > mapping.paf
yacrd -i mapping.paf -o reads.yacrd
```

### Find chimera and run post-detection operation

yacrd can perform thrid post-detection operation, on mapping or sequence file:

- filtering: yacrd generate a new file with only record without chimeric reads
- extracting: yacrd generate a new file with only record with chimeric reads
- spliting (only on sequence file) : yacrd generate a new file without chimeric region 

```
minimap2 reads.fq reads.fq > mapping.paf
yacrd chimeric -i mapping.paf -f reads.fasta > reads.yacrd # produce reads_fileterd.fasta
yacrd chimeric -i mapping.paf -e reads.fasta > reads.yacrd # produce reads_extracted.fasta
yacrd chimeric -i mapping.paf -s reads.fasta > reads.yacrd # produce reads_splited.fasta
```

### Scrubber read 

yacrd support a scrubbing mode to remove all not supported part of read.

```
minimap2 reads.fq reads.fq > mapping.paf
yacrd scrubbing -m mapping.paf -s reads.fq -S reads_scrubbed.fq -r report.yacrd
yacrd scrubbing -m mapping.paf -s reads.fq -S reads_scrubbed.fq -r report.yacrd -c 10 # Remove part not covered by 10 reads
yacrd scrubbing -m mapping.paf -s reads.fq -S reads_scrubbed.fq -j -r report.yacrd.json
```

## Output

```
type_of_read	id_in_mapping_file  length_of_read  length_of_gap,begin_pos_of_gap,end_pos_of_gap;length_of_gap,beâ€¦
```

### Example

```
Not_covered readA 4599	3782,0,3782
```

Here, readA doesn't have sufficient coverage, there is a zero-coverage region of length 3782bp between positions 0 and 3782.

```
Chimeric    readB   10452   862,1260,2122;3209,4319,7528
```

Here, readB is chimeric with 2 zero-coverage regions: one between bases 1260 and 2122, another between 3209 and 7528.

### JSON

If flag `-j` are present output are write in json format, an example:

```
{
	"1": {
		"gaps": [{
			"begin": 0,
			"end": 2000
		}, {
			"begin": 4500,
			"end": 5500
		}, {
			"begin": 8000,
			"end": 10000
		}],
		"length": 10000,
		"type": "Chimeric"
	},
	"4": {
		"gaps": [{
			"begin": 2500,
			"end": 3500
		}],
		"length": 6000,
		"type": "Chimeric"
	}
}
```
